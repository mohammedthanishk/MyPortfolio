            I'm a web development student passionate about creating modern,
            responsive websites. I started my journey in front-end development,
            working with React and Vite, and Iâ€™m now exploring backend
            technologies to become a full-stack developer. I love learning new
            technologies, solving challenges, and building user-friendly digital
            experiences. As I grow in my career, I'm excited to develop my
            skills and contribute to real-world projects.
